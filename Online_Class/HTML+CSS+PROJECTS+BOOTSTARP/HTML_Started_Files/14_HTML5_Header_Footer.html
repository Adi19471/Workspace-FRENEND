            In this tutorial, we’ll show how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React. You can see what we’ll be building here: Final Result. If the code doesn’t make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal
            of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax. We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right
            of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.</p>
